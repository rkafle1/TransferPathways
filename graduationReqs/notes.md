Stacked graph

* The schools that require either the physics or chemestry series for graduation have a higher unit count than those that don't, with the exception of UC Berkeley.

* ~~The schools that do not include lower division science electives in their list of required courses for the major may have both a CS and CSE major, where the CSE major requires science courses for graduation. Examples: UC Irvine, UC Berkeley (EECS), UC Davis~~
* The only UCs that do not list science courses as requirements for graduation are UCB, and UCSC.
* The only CSUs that do not list science courses as requirements are CSU Monterey Bay and Cal Poly Humboldt.
* UC Berkeley, Sonoma State, and CSU Fullerton have a list of math and science classes and have the student choose a few from them. I do not know how to catagorize it. Math or science?
* UC Berkeley does not have strictly required courses for upper division. They do require at least one design course chosen from a list of courses, but I am not sure if I should consider this requirement as an elective or not.
* UC Berkeley requires "20 Upper Division Units", 16 of which could be any course. I am not sure whether to count it as an elective or not.
